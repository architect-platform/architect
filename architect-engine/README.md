# Architect Engine

The Architect Engine is a plugin-based task execution engine built with Kotlin and Micronaut. It provides a flexible framework for managing projects and executing tasks through a RESTful API.

## Overview

Architect Engine allows you to:
- Register and manage projects with custom configurations
- Load and execute plugins that provide domain-specific tasks
- Execute tasks with event-driven feedback
- Support nested project structures (subprojects)

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Project Service**: Manages project registration, loading, and configuration
- **Task Service**: Handles task discovery and execution across projects
- **Plugin System**: Extensible plugin architecture using SPI (Service Provider Interface)
- **Event System**: Real-time event streaming for task execution monitoring

### Plugins

The engine comes with several built-in plugins:

1. **Workflows Plugin**: Manages workflow phases and execution
   - Core Plugin: Core workflow functionality
   - Code Plugin: Code-related workflows
   - Hooks Plugin: Git hooks management

2. **Commits Plugin**: Validates commit messages and enforces commit conventions

3. **Installers Plugin**: Manages installation scripts and resources

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle 8.x (wrapper included)

## Building

To build the project locally:

```bash
cd engine
./gradlew build
```

To run without tests:

```bash
./gradlew build -x test
```

## Running

Start the engine server:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

The server will start on port 9292 (configurable in `src/main/resources/application.yml`).

## API Endpoints

### Projects API

- `GET /api/projects` - List all registered projects
- `POST /api/projects` - Register a new project
  ```json
  {
    "name": "my-project",
    "path": "/path/to/project"
  }
  ```
- `GET /api/projects/{name}` - Get project details
- `GET /api/projects/{projectName}/config` - Get project configuration

### Tasks API

- `GET /api/projects/{projectName}/tasks` - List all tasks for a project
- `GET /api/projects/{projectName}/tasks/{taskName}` - Get task details
- `POST /api/projects/{projectName}/tasks/{taskName}` - Execute a task
  ```json
  ["arg1", "arg2"]
  ```

### Execution API

- `GET /api/executions/{executionId}/events` - Stream execution events (SSE)

## Configuration

The engine is configured through `application.yml`:

```yaml
micronaut:
  application:
    name: architect-engine
  server:
    port: 9292

engine:
  project:
    cache:
      enabled: false  # Enable/disable project caching
  plugin:
    cache:
      enabled: false  # Enable/disable plugin caching
```

## Project Configuration

Projects are configured using an `architect.yml` file in the project root:

```yaml
project:
  name: my-project
  description: "Project description"

plugins:
  - name: plugin-name
    # Plugin-specific configuration
```

```

### Adding a New Plugin

1. Implement the `Plugin` interface from architect-api
2. Create a `PluginProvider` using SPI
3. Add plugin metadata in `META-INF/services/`
4. Register tasks in the `register()` method

### Running Tests

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Docker

Build a Docker image:

```bash
./gradlew dockerBuild
```

Build a native image with GraalVM:

```bash
./gradlew dockerBuildNative
```
